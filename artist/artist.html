                        I’m inspired by humanity in all its forms. Photography is an excuse to get closer to people and to hear their stories. That’s how I got started as a photographer, simply meeting people and taking the time to talk to them.

        <div class="eLifeContent">
            <p>
                <span>Réhahn was born in Bayeux in Normandy, France. An avid traveller, he voyaged to more than 35 countries with his camera before settling in the coastal town of Hoi An. Vietnam and its culture had inspired him since he visited for the first time while on a humanitarian mission with the French NGO Les Enfants du Vietnam.</span>
                <span>Referred to as someone who “captures the souls of his models” (Wanderlust Travel Magazine, 2018), the French photographer is more than just a man behind a camera.
                </span>
                <span>Behind each photograph is a story. Each image is the culmination of an experience. The stories of his subjects as well as his passion for learning more about their culture, diversity and changing traditions are what drives the artist’s work.</span>

            <p>A good connection (and photograph) must start with respect. I always put my camera away and give my full attention to the person I’m meeting so that trust can build organically.

                <h1>THE START OF RÉHAHN’S CAREER</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="careerContent">
                <p>In 2011, the artist met the woman who would change the course of his life and career – Bui Thi Xong.
                    The 72-year-old tour boat captain had spent her entire life floating up and down the river in Hoi An. When he asked if he could take her photograph, she laughed and covered her mouth. The resulting image, “Hidden Smile”, became the most significant photograph in Réhahn’s career. It was published worldwide and eventually became one of the most iconic images of modern Vietnam.
                    More importantly for the photographer, the encounter started his lifelong friendship with Xong and inspired his Giving Back Project.</p>
                <p>In 2015, the Asian House Museum in Havana, Cuba, chose “Hidden Smile” for its permanent collection. One year later, the Hanoi Women’s Museum added it to the permanent collection for International Women’s Day.
                    Vietnam’s Secretary of the Party, Nguyen Phu Trong (the current President of Vietnam), gave an Edition of “Hidden Smile” to French President Emmanuel Macron. This pinnacle moment occurred in 2018 during an official ceremony celebrating 45 years of friendship between France and Vietnam. (watch the vidéo of the ceremony)
                    This famous photograph even set a record when it became the most expensive photograph ever sold in Asia, after being purchased by a private collector for 150k (read the NY Weekly article)</p>
